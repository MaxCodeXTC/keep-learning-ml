# Keep Learning ML Club

In an effort to connect, keep learning, meet people, discuss and share ideas, I am starting a special online learning club called Keep Learning ML. 

This initial idea is simple. Every week we will host 1 hour sessions (via Zoom) where we have students, researchers, or practitioners talk about one ML or NLP idea, paper, tool, resource, or blog post they found interesting and just wanted to share with others. 

### How to join and participate?

To be a member, join the #keep-learing-ml-club channel in our Slack group. There you will find additional instructions on how to participate. 

To participate, you will prepare 1-3 slides and your presentation shouldnâ€™t last more than 5 minutes. We will all share our slides in one master slide that is accessible and editable to everyone on the group. You can also join the meeting and you don't need to present anything, it's up to you. But I challenge you to **keep learning** and sharing what you have learned.  

### What to present?

Some ideas on what to present could include but not limited to:
- A notebook you found interesting
- A mathematical concept used in ML
- An interesting paper you came across
- An interesting ML/NLP resource
- An ML/NLP tool you want to quickly demo
- A piece of code
- A piece of news on AI

### Why should you join? 

To encourage yourself to keep learning everyday and of course to meet/connect with awesome people from the ML community.

Please ensure to follow the code of conduct. Ideally, we want to build an inclusive community where we learn from each other but respect each other as well.
